# A Thirst for Death
#### *Exploring the potential of simple, space-filling datasets to illuminate common subjects of social and economic data science.*

## Concept:

We wanted to demonstrate the potential of well-organized space-filling datasets to illuminate or correct trends in apparently unrelated data domains. The idea was to capture a small number of dimensions from a comprehensive dataset into a form where they could be rapidly collated and compared to unrelated datsets.

We chose to work with drought data because of it's availability and comprehensiveness along with the possibility that drought (long-duration event with drastic effects on the natural world) might be reveled to have subtle impacts on any number of natural and social systems.

## Method:

We acquired two initial datasets. 

For our space-filling dataset, we retrieved drought categorizations from the [USDA Drought monitor API](https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu). This service provides drought category data for all locations in the US for all weeks from Jan 1, 2000 until the present, making it possible to insert drought-related dimensions into any dataset which specifies date and a location, with proper formatting.

For our target dataset, we
